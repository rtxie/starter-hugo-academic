abstract: 'Recently, deep learning has been used to tackle mobile sensing problems,
  and the inference phase of deep learning is preferred to be run on mobile devices
  for speedy responses. However, mobile devices are resource-constrained platforms
  for both computation and power. Moreover, an inference task with deep learning involves
  tens of billions of mathematical operations and tens of millions of parameter reads.
  Thus, it is a critical issue to reduce the energy consumption of deep learning inference
  algorithms. In this article, we survey various energy reduction approaches, and
  classify them into three categories: the compressing neural network model, minimizing
  the data transfer required in computation, and offloading workloads. Moreover, we
  simulate and compare three techniques of model compression, by applying them to
  an object recognition problem.'
