abstract: With the recent development of wireless communication, sensing, and computing
  technologies, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has attracted great attention in both academia
  and industry. Nevertheless, it is challenging to process time-critical tasks due
  to unique characteristics of IoV, including heterogeneous computation and communication
  capacities of network nodes, intermittent wireless connections, unevenly distributed
  workload, massive data transmission, intensive computation demands, and high mobility
  of vehicles. In this article, we propose a two-layer vehicular fog computing (VFC)
  architecture to explore the synergistic effect of the cloud, the static fog, and
  the mobile fog on processing time-critical tasks in IoV. Then, we give a motivational
  case study by implementing a prototype of a traffic abnormity detection and warning
  system, which demonstrates the necessity and urgency of developing adaptive task
  offloading mechanisms in such a scenario and gives insight into the problem formulation.
  Furthermore, we formulate the offloading model, aiming at maximizing the completion
  ratio of time-critical tasks. On this basis, we propose an adaptive task offloading
  algorithm (ATOA). Specifically, it adaptively categorizes all tasks into four types
  of pending lists by considering the dynamic requirements and resource constraints,
  and then tasks in each list will be cooperatively offloaded to different nodes based
  on their features. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive
  performance evaluation. The results demonstrate the superiority of ATOA.
