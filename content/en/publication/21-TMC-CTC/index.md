abstract: The coexistence of heterogeneous devices in wireless networks brings a new
  topic on cross-technology communication (CTC) to improve the coexistence efficiency
  and boost collaboration among these devices. Current advances on CTC mainly fall
  into two categories, $physical-layer CTC$ and $packet-level energy modulation$ (PLEM).
  The $physical-layer CTC$ achieves a high CTC data rate, but with channel incompatible
  to commercial devices, making it hard to be deployed in current wireless networks.
  PLEM is channel and physical layer compatible, but with two main drawbacks of the
  low CTC data rate and MAC incompatibility, which will induce severe interference
  to the other devices' normal data transmissions. In this paper, we propose symbol-level
  energy modulation (SLEM), the first CTC method that is fully compatible with current
  devices in both channel and the physical/MAC layer processes, having the ability
  to be deployed in commercial wireless networks smoothly. SLEM inserts extra bits
  to WiFi data bits to generate the transmitting bits, so as to adjust the energy
  levels of WiFi symbols to deliver CTC information. We make theoretical analysis
  to figure out performance of both CTC and WiFi transmissions. We also conduct experiments
  to demonstrate the feasibility of SLEM and its performance under different network
  situations.
