abstract: The emerging vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) enables vehicles to access
  the Internet through roadside access points (APs). An important issue in system
  deployment is determining how many roadside APs shall be installed on a road. However,
  the existing works fail to provide rigorous and accurate analysis for VANETs. In
  this paper, we propose a general structure for Internet access in VANETs. It allows
  both real-time traffic and delay-tolerant traffic to be delivered to users in the
  most efficient ways. An analytical model is also proposed to analyze the system
  performance with random arrival of the vehicles. We finally develop an AP placement
  algorithm based on theoretical results derived from the model to deploy the minimal
  number of roadside APs with quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. The simulation
  results have demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed analytical model and the
  efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
