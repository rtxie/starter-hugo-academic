abstract: Software Defined Networking has been adopted to improve data center network
  efficiency. In SDN, the controllers are responsible for exchanging information with
  the switches to perform specific operations such as data forwarding. The transmission
  of control traffic usually uses networks different from data networks. However,
  building an additional wired network for the control traffic leads to high cabling
  complexity. Since a wireless network involves almost no cabling and is easy to install,
  we propose a wireless solution where switches make a wireless connection with controllers
  via wireless access points (AP). In this design, switches are divided into clusters,
  and an AP is placed at the center of each cluster. An important issue is to determine
  the minimum number of APs such that a given control traffic demand can be met. We
  propose an analytical model to evaluate the system throughput for possible clusterings,
  and an efficient algorithm to search for the optimal one. The extensive simulations
  demonstrate that our method can reduce cabling complexity significantly.
