abstract: Leveraging emerging mobile edge computing and 5G networks, researchers proposed
  to offload the 3D rendering of interactive applications (e.g. virtual reality and
  cloud gaming onto GPU-based edge servers to reduce the user experienced latency.
  A task offloading problem arises, that is where to offload rendering tasks such
  that each user will experience tolerable delay and meanwhile the cost of used servers
  is minimized. The multi-dimensional resource sharing feature of rendering tasks
  makes the problem challenging. We formulate the task offloading problem into a boolean
  linear programming. We propose a sharing-aware offloading algorithm which decomposes
  the problem into two subproblems (user assignment and server packing and solves
  them alternately and iteratively. We compare our algorithm with the one without
  resource sharing in consideration, and the simulations demonstrate that our method
  can effectively reduce cost as well as satisfy delay requirement.
