abstract: The variation of wireless signal in dynamic indoor parking environments
  may seriously compromise the performance of fingerprint-based localization methods.
  In this regard, this paper investigates the problem of robust WiFi fingerprint-based
  vehicle tracking in dynamic indoor parking environments, aiming at designing an
  online learning framework to continuously train the localization model and counteract
  the effect of signal variation. Specifically, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based
  Online Evaluation (HOE) method is firstly proposed to assess the accuracy of localization
  results by measuring the inconsistency of locations inferred by WiFi fingerprinting
  and Dead Reckoning (DR). Further, an Online Transfer Learning (OTL) algorithm is
  designed to improve the robustness of the fingerprinting localization, which consists
  of a weight allocation scheme to combine two classification models (i.e., the batch
  model and the online model) and an instance-based transferring scheme to resample
  the offline fingerprints and retrain the batch model. Finally, we implement the
  system prototype and give comprehensive performance evaluation, which demonstrates
  that the proposed solutions can outperform the state-of-the-art localization algorithms
  around 28% $∼$ 58% on vehicle tracking accuracy in dynamic indoor parking environments.
