abstract: Public auditing schemes for cloud storage systems have been extensively
  explored with the increasing importance of data integrity. A third-party auditor
  (TPA) is introduced in public auditing schemes to verify the integrity of outsourced
  data on behalf of users. To resist malicious TPAs, many blockchain-based public
  verification schemes have been proposed. However, existing auditing schemes rely
  on a centralized TPA, and they are vulnerable to tempting auditors who may collude
  with malicious blockchain miners to produce biased auditing results. In this paper,
  we propose a blockchain-based decentralized public auditing (BDPA) scheme by utilizing
  a decentralized blockchain network to undertake the responsibility of a centralized
  TPA, and also mitigate the influence of tempting auditors and malicious blockchain
  miners by taking the concept of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). A detailed
  security analysis shows that BDPA can preserve data integrity against tempting auditors
  and malicious blockchain miners. A comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates
  that BDPA is feasible and scalable.
