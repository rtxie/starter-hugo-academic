abstract: 'Cloud computing is an emerging computational infrastructure for cost-efficient
  workflow execution that provides flexible and dynamically scalable computing resources
  at pay-as-you-go pricing. Workflow scheduling, as a typical NP-Complete problem,
  is one of the major issues in cloud computing. However, in the cloud scenario with
  unlimited resources, how to generate an efficient and economical workflow scheduling
  scheme under the deadline constraint is still an extraordinary challenge. In this
  paper, we propose a hybrid heuristic algorithm called enhanced task type first algorithm
  (ET2FA) to solve deadline-constrained workflow scheduling in cloud with new features
  such as hibernation and per-second billing. The objectives to be minimized include
  the total cost and total idle rate. ET2FA involves three phases: 1) Task type first
  algorithm, which schedules tasks based on topological level and task types, and
  utilizes a compact-scheduling-condition based VM selection method to assign each
  task. 2) Delay operation based on block structure, which further optimizes total
  cost and total idle rate based on block structure properties. 3) Instance hibernate
  scheduling heuristic, which sets an instance to hibernate if idle for a duration.
  Extensive simulation experiments based on seven well-known real-world workflow applications
  show that ET2FA delivers better performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art
  algorithms.'
